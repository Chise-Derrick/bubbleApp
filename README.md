This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.


### `https://bubbleapp-dev.web.app/`

Open [https://bubbleapp-dev.web.app/](https://bubbleapp-dev.web.app/) to view it in the browser.

This app uses Firebase Auth and Firebase Firestore as a database.<br />
The local sitters, current bookings and user information are all being pulled from this.
There are axios functions to pull from the original API and update Firebase when neccessary.<br />
The app is mobile ready and adjusts to any screen size.


### `Next Steps`

My next steps would be to create a booking screen ( add Router rather than modals )

Also, functionality for ratings, messaging and feedback would be forthcoming.
